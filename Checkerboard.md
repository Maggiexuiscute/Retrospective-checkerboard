# Reflect on the work you did for the challenge.
In the previous assignment, I did the following things:
1. Created a CheckerBoard class.
2. Created a container of AnchorPane and selection bar.
3. Generated rectangles which are the children of AnchorPane. 
4. Generated the color of rectangles by using the index of array element.
5. Generated a new AnchorPane when the settings are updated.
6. Finally, made the grid size, color scheme and rectangle size changeable by clicking or dragging. 
 
# How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?
Well, I think the foundational knowlege is needed of course, like encapsulation and hereditability for example. Also, to understand generating a javaFX UI through a class is important. And how to activate events through controller is the core thing.
In the challenge, the foundational knowleged did not bother me a lot. But It took me some days to be familiar with javaFX UI and its hierarchies

# How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?
According to the results, I met all the requirements.

# How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?
My solution was basically match the posted solution except some details, like the selecting different sizes and colors in the controller. I used different methods in my solution, but the posted solution used switch instead, which might be more efficient.

# How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?
1. Documented the code well.
2. Improve the controller to make it easily modifiable.
3. Simplify the code and avoid the superfluous code.
